//! GATE — the only decider.
//!
//! The engine's law is *ATTEND weights, GATE decides* (`atom-cognitive-engine`,
//! `SKILL.md:32`). ATTEND produces a [`Candidate`] — a weighted concern — and
//! never a [`Decision`]. Only [`gate`] turns a candidate (plus its evidence)
//! into one of the action outcomes below, and only [`Decision::control`] turns
//! an outcome into a `ControlMsg`.
//!
//! The five outcomes map onto the *existing* `ControlMsg` vocabulary
//! (`crates/spiderweb/src/lib.rs`), so the cognitive spider can never invent a
//! message kind:
//!
//! | GATE outcome | `ControlMsg` |
//! |---|---|
//! | pass | *nothing* |
//! | abstain | *nothing* (abstention is a pass on the wire) |
//! | block | `ControlMsg::Quarantine` |
//! | redirect (instance) | `ControlMsg::Restart` |
//! | redirect (topology) | `ControlMsg::SetTransfer` |
//!
//! This module is pure: no clock, no I/O, no state. That is what makes the
//! mapping directly testable.
