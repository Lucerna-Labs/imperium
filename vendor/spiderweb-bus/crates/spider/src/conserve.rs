//! CONSERVE — the alert budget.
//!
//! The web must never be flooded with alerts by the very mechanism meant to
//! protect it. Emission is already edge-triggered upstream (a strand emits a
//! `Vibration` only when its depth changes), and GATE emits only on a state
//! transition; this module adds the last layer: a rolling-window budget with
//! **weakest-first** admission.
//!
//! When more candidates want an emission slot than the window has left,
//! candidates are ranked by salience (descending, node name as a deterministic
//! tie-break) and only the strongest fit. The weakest are dropped — so a burst
//! of small anomalies can never evict a single severe one.
//!
//! The budget is epistemic admission control, not merely a rate limit: a
//! candidate that cannot fit is, by construction, evidence the engine does not
//! consider worth the operator's attention. That is the same posture as the
//! query side's abstention.
