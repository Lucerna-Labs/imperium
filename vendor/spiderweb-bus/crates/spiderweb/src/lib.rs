//! `spiderweb` — a plug-and-play bus for Rust strands.
//!
//! Primitives: threads, channels, a type registry. No Tokio. No `async`.
//!
//! A crate implements [`Strand`], calls [`Bus::register`], and the kernel
//! does the rest. Messages flow by type. Subscribers fan out automatically.
//! Multiple instances of the same strand are separate subscribers (free
//! redundancy). Crashed strands are restarted by the kernel up to a
//! configurable limit; the [`spider`](https://docs.rs/spider) crate is the
//! default orchestrator that decides when to restart vs. quarantine.
//!
//! v1.2 supports fan-out of any `T: Clone + Send + 'static`. For non-Clone
//! payloads (large buffers, etc.), serialize to a `String` or upgrade to
//! v1.3+ which will add transparent Arc<T> support.
//!
//! See `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the workspace root for the design.
