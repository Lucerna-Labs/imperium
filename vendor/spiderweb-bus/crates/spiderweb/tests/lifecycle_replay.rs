//! A lifecycle event published before a consumer subscribed must still reach it.
//!
//! Work traffic already has this property: `deliver` appends every message to a
//! per-type replay buffer, and `subscribe` replays that buffer to a new
//! subscriber atomically with the subscriber snapshot (so delivery is
//! exactly-once — never both a replay and a direct send, never neither).
//!
//! Lifecycle traffic does not. `publish_lifecycle` calls `deliver_internal`,
//! which fans out only to the subscribers registered at that instant and never
//! touches `pending`. So a `Crashed` published before the supervisor subscribed
//! reaches nobody: the slot is parked waiting for a `ControlMsg` that can never
//! arrive, and the strand is never restarted or quarantined. A failure report
//! that goes missing entirely is worse than one that gets acted on.
//!
//! This test is deliberately deterministic — it does not depend on thread
//! timing, unlike the real-world manifestation (which only shows up under the
//! thread pressure of a full parallel test run). It publishes the lifecycle
//! event with no subscriber alive, waits long enough that the event has
//! certainly been published, and only then introduces a consumer.
