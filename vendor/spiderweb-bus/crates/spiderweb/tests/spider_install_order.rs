//! Supervision of a strand that crashes as soon as it starts.
//!
//! This asserts the crash policy end to end: crash → restart ×3 → quarantine.
//!
//! **It is NOT a regression test for the install-order window**, and I want that
//! on the record because it looks like one. The failure mode is real — a
//! lifecycle event reaches only the subscribers registered at the instant it is
//! published, because `publish_lifecycle` goes through `deliver_internal`, which
//! (unlike the work-traffic path in `deliver`) does not append to the per-type
//! replay buffer. So a strand that crashes before the spider has *subscribed*
//! publishes `Crashed` to nobody, its slot is parked waiting for a `ControlMsg`
//! that never comes, and it is never restarted or quarantined.
//!
//! But the window is the gap between `install_slot` returning and the spider's
//! worker thread actually calling `subscribe` — a thread spawn plus a hashmap
//! insert, i.e. microseconds. Publishing the victim's spec before the spider's
//! does not reliably lose that race, so this file passed both with and without
//! the install-order hoist in `run_until`. It was observed failing under a full
//! parallel `cargo test --workspace` run (a 60-binary load widens the window),
//! which is where it was first diagnosed from.
//!
//! Closing it properly means buffering lifecycle events for late subscribers,
//! the way work traffic already is. That is a real behaviour change to shared
//! delivery code and it needs a deterministic reproduction first — one that does
//! not depend on thread timing — so it is deliberately NOT attempted here. Open
//! questions for that change, recorded rather than guessed at:
//!
//! - Does `subscribe`'s existing exactly-once guarantee (append + subscriber
//!   snapshot under both locks, in one critical section) extend cleanly to
//!   `publish_lifecycle`, or does the replay path need its own guard?
//! - `publish_control` shares the same `deliver_internal` path. Replaying stale
//!   `ControlMsg` to a late subscriber is probably wrong, so the buffering is
//!   likely lifecycle-only — which means `deliver_internal` grows a flag.
//! - A crash that happens before `register_spider` is *terminal* today: with no
//!   spider registered the kernel removes the slot instead of parking it, so
//!   buffering alone would not recover it. That is a separate, register-order
//!   question.
//!
//! This test documents the end-to-end crash policy that exists today.
